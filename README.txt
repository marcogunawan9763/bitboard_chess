    encoding moves as integers
    copy/make approach
    negamax search with alpha-beta pruning
    PV/killer/history move ordering
    iterative deepening
    transposition tables
    material/positions/pawns/mobility/king safety evaluation

I am compilating his works and adapting it in C++, developing my own engine with hopefully some tweaks/
improvements. However the main purpose of this codebase is personal education regarding how chess engines 
are implemented and organisational skills/ industry practice on project code documentation, github, etc.

I am also implementing it in C++ instead of C, to hopefully learn a new language as well ^^
